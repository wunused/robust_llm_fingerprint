                "It seems that you are trying to write a LaTeX document, but you have some errors in your code. LaTeX is a typesetting language that uses special symbols and commands to format mathematical expressions, equations, and other elements. One of the common errors that you have is using the wrong symbols or characters for LaTeX commands. For example, you have used % instead of \\% to escape a special character, and [ instead of [ to enclose a list or an item.\n\nTo fix your code, you need to replace % with \\ and [ with [. Here is an example of how to write a simple equation in LaTeX:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nx^2 + 2x - 4 = 0\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis will produce the following output:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 4 = 0\n\nYou can also use other LaTeX commands to format your document, such as \\begin{document}, \\end{document}, \\begin{tabular}, \\end{tabular}, \\hline, etc. You can find more information about LaTeX commands and syntax in the official LaTeX documentation or in online tutorials and resources.\n\nI hope this helps you with your LaTeX document. If you have any other questions or need more assistance, please let me know.</s>"
